# Shared EMC

An expansion of [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte) that allows for multiple users to share the EMC values between them.

It is specially useful to use together with [Project Expansion](https://github.com/DonovanDMC/ProjectExpansion), so multiple users can share Project Expansion's machines more easily.

## Usage

This mod adds the `/shareEMC` command.

`/shareEMC team create` creates a new sharing group.
`/shareEMC team invite <Player>` adds a player to the sharing group.
`/shareEMC team leave` leaves the sharing group.
`/shareEMC team list` lists all players in the sharing group.

## Warning

As I developed this for personal use, there is no "security" on the teams. So a team owner can add _any_ player to the group, effectivelly "stealing" half of the EMC of the target player. This should be fine if you are just playing with some friends, but could be a problem in bigger servers.

## Support

This mod was developed for personal use for me an some friends to be able to share EMC. I don't plan on supporting this long term, but if you are interested in it for a specific version of minecraft, let me know by creating an issue.
